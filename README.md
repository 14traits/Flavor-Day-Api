# Backend Read Me

# Real-time Server

We are running a Ruby on rails framework

Ruby on Rails is a server-side web application framework written in Ruby under the MIT License. Rails is a model–view–controller framework, providing default structures for a database, a web service, and web pages. 

# ~~GraphQL~~

~~We use GraphQL for writing our backend APIs. For a guide on getting started with GraphQL, check out this [documentation](https://graphql.org/learn/).~~ 

# Postgres

We use Postgres for our database. For a guide on getting started with Postgres, check out this [documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/manuals/). 

# Swagger

We use the RSwag Gem for documenting our API. For a guide on getting started with RSwag, check out this [documentation](https://github.com/rswag/rswag). 

Once you have your Dev/Testing server up (hint: `rails s`) visit [http://localhost:3000/api-docs/index.html](http://localhost:3000/api-docs/index.html)

# Whenever Gem

We use the Whatever gem to pull from culvers API and feed our database. For a guide on getting started with Whatever Gem, check out this [documentation](https://github.com/javan/whenever).
